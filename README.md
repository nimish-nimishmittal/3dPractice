## Introduction

This portfolio showcases my skills and projects in a visually appealing and interactive format. Leveraging **Vite** for blazing fast builds and **React** for component-driven development, this project also incorporates **Spline** for rendering stunning 3D models. With these tools, the portfolio combines smooth performance with an engaging user experience, providing visitors with an interactive journey through my work.

## Features

- **Fast Development**: Vite ensures a quick development experience with hot-reloading.
- **Modern UI**: Built with React, creating a dynamic and reusable component-based structure.
- **3D Models**: Integration with **Spline** to load and render 3D models directly into the project.
- **Optimized Build**: Vite provides optimized production builds with minified code and fast serving.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn (depending on your preference)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-vite-react.git
    cd portfolio-vite-react
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Run the development server**:

    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    Your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

You can start developing your portfolio by modifying the provided components, pages, and assets. To integrate Spline 3D models, follow these steps:

1. **Go to [Spline](https://spline.design/)** and design or download a 3D model.
2. **Export the model** using Spline's web export feature.
3. **Import the model** in your project and render it within a React component.

For example, you can create a component to display your 3D model like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Spline } from '@splinetool/react-spline';

const My3DModel = () => {
  return (
    <Spline scene="https://prod.spline.design/your-model-url/scene.splinecode" />
  );
};

export default My3DModel;
```
